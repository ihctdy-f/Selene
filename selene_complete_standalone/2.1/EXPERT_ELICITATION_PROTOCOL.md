# Expert Elicitation Protocol
## Project Selene ABM — Phase 5.1 Preparation

**Document Type:** Methodology Protocol (DRAFT)  
**Status:** Ready for Review  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Target Execution:** Upon Funding Authorization (+60 days)

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol establishes the methodology for eliciting expert judgment on the behavioral and structural assumptions underlying the Project Selene ABM. The goal is to assess face validity of mechanism hypotheses independent of model outputs.

### Why Expert Elicitation?

1. **Assumption Validation:** Model mechanisms are based on theoretical reasoning and historical analogy, not direct observation of Selene-like systems
2. **Structural Uncertainty:** Different experts would build different models; elicitation surfaces the range of plausible alternatives
3. **Review Requirement:** Distinguished Professor and Principal Scientist specified expert elicitation as prerequisite for decision-grade status

### Success Criteria

- 5-8 experts complete structured elicitation
- Each mechanism hypothesis receives plausibility assessment
- Failure conditions and missing dynamics documented
- Results enable model revision or documented justification for current specification

## 3. Elicitation Design

### Blind Presentation Principle

**Critical:** Experts review mechanism hypotheses WITHOUT seeing model outputs.

Rationale: If experts know the model produces "+42pp mechanism effect," they cannot independently assess whether the assumptions warranting that effect are plausible. Blind review ensures independent judgment.

### Information Provided to Experts

**Include:**
- Mechanism hypothesis descriptions (prose, not code)
- Historical analogs cited (ECSC, EDC, Airbus)
- General project context (cislunar consortium goal)
- Questions to answer (see Section 4)

**Exclude:**
- Model outputs (success rates, effect sizes)
- Parameter values
- Validation/calibration results
- Team's assessment of model quality

### Elicitation Format

**Phase A: Written Review (Asynchronous, ~2 hours)**
- Expert receives mechanism hypothesis document
- Completes structured assessment questionnaire
- Returns within 7 days

**Phase B: Follow-up Interview (Synchronous, ~1 hour)**
- Clarify questionnaire responses
- Probe failure conditions in depth
- Discuss missing dynamics
- Conducted by facilitator (not model developers)

**Phase C: Aggregation Review (Optional)**
- Experts see anonymized aggregate responses
- Opportunity to revise or annotate
- Identifies consensus vs. disagreement

## 4. Mechanism Hypotheses for Review

### Hypothesis 1: Sunk Cost Lock-In

**Statement:**
> "As consortium members accumulate sunk costs (capital investment, infrastructure deployment), their probability of defection decreases. This effect operates through both economic rationality (loss aversion) and political economy (domestic accountability for wasted investment)."

**Questions:**
1. Is this behavioral assumption plausible for state actors in multilateral infrastructure projects? (1=Implausible, 5=Highly Plausible)
2. Under what conditions would this assumption fail?
3. Are there historical cases that support or contradict this mechanism?
4. What alternative formulation would you consider more realistic?

---

### Hypothesis 2: Trust Evolution

**Statement:**
> "Trust between consortium members increases incrementally with successful cooperation (phase completion) and decreases with defections or external shocks. Trust is bilateral (between specific pairs) and aggregates to global trust."

**Questions:**
1. Is this trust evolution rule plausible? (1-5)
2. Under what conditions would trust evolve differently (e.g., sudden collapse, path dependency)?
3. Is bilateral vs. global trust distinction important?
4. What trust dynamics are missing from this formulation?

---

### Hypothesis 3: Escrow Forfeiture Deterrence

**Statement:**
> "Requiring members to escrow funds that are forfeited upon withdrawal (after a commitment threshold) deters defection. The deterrent effect scales with the ratio of escrow to total investment."

**Questions:**
1. Is escrow forfeiture an effective deterrent for state actors? (1-5)
2. Under what conditions would states defect despite forfeiture penalties?
3. Are there examples of similar mechanisms in international agreements?
4. What unintended consequences might this mechanism produce?

---

### Hypothesis 4: Poison Pill Cascade

**Statement:**
> "If multiple members withdraw after the irreversibility threshold, remaining members face operational failure. This creates mutual deterrence: each member knows their withdrawal could trigger cascade, which deters defection but also creates fragility."

**Questions:**
1. Is this interdependence dynamic realistic for infrastructure consortiums? (1-5)
2. Does mutual deterrence strengthen or weaken consortium stability?
3. What cascade trigger threshold (2, 3, 4 members) seems most realistic?
4. How would rational actors respond to known cascade risk?

---

### Hypothesis 5: External Shock Effects

**Statement:**
> "Exogenous political shocks (elections, economic crises, diplomatic incidents) temporarily increase defection probability. Shocks are assumed independent across time periods (IID)."

**Questions:**
1. Is the IID shock assumption reasonable? (1-5)
2. Are geopolitical shocks better modeled as correlated, clustered, or regime-dependent?
3. What shock types are most likely to trigger consortium defection?
4. What shock intensity (mild/severe) should be considered "regime changing"?

---

### Hypothesis 6: Agent Heterogeneity

**Statement:**
> "Different consortium members have different base defection probabilities based on their category (core founder, associate, tenant). These differences are stable over time."

**Questions:**
1. Is categorical agent heterogeneity realistic? (1-5)
2. Should agent types be fixed or evolving?
3. What drives differences in defection propensity across member types?
4. Are there important agent characteristics not captured by this typology?

---

### Hypothesis 7: Domestic Politics (Veto Risk)

**Statement:**
> "Even when executive leadership supports continued participation, domestic political processes (legislative veto, coalition collapse) can force withdrawal. This risk is higher in later phases when costs are visible."

**Questions:**
1. Is domestic veto a significant risk for multilateral infrastructure? (1-5)
2. Is domestic veto risk higher in early or late phases?
3. What factors predict domestic veto risk across different political systems?
4. How should the model represent domestic politics beyond binary veto?

---

### Hypothesis 8: Bilateral-Consortium Linkage

**Statement:**
> "Bilateral tensions between specific member pairs (e.g., China-Japan) propagate to consortium-level dynamics, increasing overall instability even when other relationships are stable."

**Questions:**
1. Is bilateral-consortium contagion realistic? (1-5)
2. How strong is the linkage (full transmission vs. partial insulation)?
3. Can consortium governance mechanisms insulate against bilateral tensions?
4. What bilateral relationships would be most destabilizing for Selene-type consortium?

## 5. Assessment Questionnaire

### Structured Response Format

For each hypothesis, experts complete:

**A. Plausibility Rating**
- Scale: 1 (Implausible) to 5 (Highly Plausible)
- Anchors provided:
  - 1 = "Would not include in any serious model"
  - 3 = "Reasonable working assumption with caveats"
  - 5 = "Well-established, high confidence"

**B. Confidence in Rating**
- Scale: Low / Medium / High
- Reflects expert's certainty in their own assessment

**C. Failure Conditions (Open Response)**
- "Under what conditions would this assumption produce misleading results?"

**D. Alternative Formulation (Open Response)**
- "If you were building a model, how would you represent this mechanism?"

**E. Missing Dynamics (Open Response)**
- "What important dynamics are NOT captured by this hypothesis?"

### Example Response Template

```
HYPOTHESIS 1: Sunk Cost Lock-In

A. Plausibility: [4]
B. Confidence: [Medium]
C. Failure Conditions: 
   "Assumption may fail when domestic political costs of continued 
   participation exceed sunk cost considerations (see EDC case). 
   Also fails if major leadership change enables blame-shifting to 
   predecessor administration."
D. Alternative Formulation:
   "Would add threshold effect: sunk costs only deter after reaching
   substantial level (~€5B). Below threshold, minimal deterrence."
E. Missing Dynamics:
   "Model doesn't capture strategic signaling—states may invest 
   specifically to signal commitment, not just accumulate costs."
```

## 6. Analysis Plan

### Quantitative Aggregation

For plausibility ratings:
- Calculate mean, median, and range across experts
- Identify high-consensus (SD < 0.5) vs. low-consensus (SD > 1.0) hypotheses
- Flag hypotheses with mean rating < 3.0 for potential revision

### Qualitative Synthesis

For open responses:
- Code failure conditions into categories
- Identify recurring themes in alternative formulations
- Compile comprehensive list of missing dynamics

### Revision Decision Framework

| Expert Consensus | Mean Rating | Action |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| High (SD < 0.5) | ≥ 4.0 | Retain assumption |
| High | 3.0-3.9 | Retain with sensitivity test |
| High | < 3.0 | Revise or remove assumption |
| Low (SD > 1.0) | Any | Document disagreement; test alternatives |

### Documentation Deliverables
