## Out-of-Sample Validation for Project SELENE ABM

**Document Type:** Historical Research Compilation  
**Purpose:** Phase 5.2 Out-of-Sample Validation  
**Status:** Secondary Sources Acquired  
**Date:** January 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

This document compiles secondary source research on the Airbus consortium (1967-1979) for use as an out-of-sample validation case for the SELENE consortium ABM. The Airbus case offers a compelling test because:

1. **Structural Similarity:** Multilateral European consortium with government backing
2. **Defection Event:** UK withdrawal in April 1969 followed by continuation
3. **Return Mechanism:** UK rejoined in January 1979
4. **Different Sector:** Aviation (not coal/steel), testing cross-domain applicability

**Key Validation Question:** Can ECSC-calibrated model parameters predict the Airbus trajectory without re-tuning?

## 3. Agent Profiles at Formation (1967)

### 3.1 United Kingdom

**Initial Position:**
- Hawker Siddeley Aviation primary industrial partner
- Government backing under Harold Wilson (Labour)
- 37.5% work share in original MoU
- Assigned: Wing design and manufacture (critical component)
- Rolls-Royce to develop engines (RB207)

**Trust Indicators (Estimated: 0.4-0.5):**
- Recent EEC membership rejections (1962, 1967) created Franco-British tension
- Competing domestic interests (BAC Three-Eleven proposal)
- Concurrent Concorde commitment straining resources
- Strong US aerospace ties creating alternative options

**Defection Factors:**
- Economic pressure: Inherited debts, balance of payments crisis
- Domestic politics: Government skepticism about commercial viability
- Technical: Rolls-Royce engine development delays
- Strategic: Belief UK could compete independently with American giants

### 3.2 France

**Initial Position:**
- Sud Aviation designated "lead company"
- 37.5% work share
- Assigned: Cockpit, flight control, lower centre fuselage
- Strong government backing (Gaullist industrial policy)

**Trust Indicators (Estimated: 0.6-0.7):**
- Committed to European industrial integration
- Concorde partnership demonstrated collaboration capacity
- Roger Béteille's vision for technology integration
- Less dependent on US aerospace ties

**Continuation Factors:**
- Sunk cost commitment to Toulouse facilities
- National prestige investment
- Industrial policy alignment
- Partnership with Germany strategically valuable

### 3.3 West Germany

**Initial Position:**
- Deutsche Airbus consortium (MBB 65%, VFW-Fokker 35%)
- 25% work share initially, increased to 50% after UK withdrawal
- Assigned: Forward/rear fuselage, upper centre section
- Aim: Relaunch and rationalize German aerospace industry

**Trust Indicators (Estimated: 0.5-0.6):**
- Strong interest in European integration
- Less historical aerospace capability than UK/France
- Government commitment to multilateral projects
- Industrial policy priority

**Continuation Factors:**
- Increased stake after UK withdrawal
- Strong government backing
- Strategic value of partnership with France
- No viable independent alternative

## 4. The UK Withdrawal: Detailed Analysis

### 4.1 Official Rationale

Anthony Wedgwood Benn (Minister of Technology) announced April 10, 1969:
> "The government was not satisfied that it was a good investment."

### 4.2 Contributing Factors

**Economic Pressures:**
- Severe balance of payments difficulties
- Devaluation of pound (1967)
- Limited government capital for aerospace investment
- Concorde cost overruns consuming available funds

**Domestic Politics:**
- Wilson government prioritizing industrial restructuring
- Aircraft sector fragmentation requiring consolidation
- Competing interests between BAC and Hawker Siddeley
- BAC's Three-Eleven proposal as alternative

**Technical Issues:**
- Rolls-Royce RB207 engine delays
- Concerns about twin-engine wide-body viability
- Market projections questioned

**Strategic Miscalculation:**
- Belief UK aerospace could compete independently
- Underestimation of European consortium potential
- Optimism about BAC Three-Eleven prospects

### 4.3 Timing Significance

UK withdrawal announced April 10, 1969 — one day after first UK-assembled Concorde flew from Filton. This timing suggests:
- Concorde commitment was perceived as sufficient European engagement
- Resources redirected from Airbus to Concorde
- Political calculation about national prestige priorities

### 4.4 Partial Continuation

Despite government withdrawal, Hawker Siddeley continued as **private subcontractor** for wing design:
- Wing design work too advanced to transfer
- Other nations reluctant to assume wing responsibility
- HS maintained foot in door for eventual return

This represents a **partial defection** — government exit but industrial participation continued.

## 5. France-Germany Continuation

### 5.1 Decision to Proceed

After UK withdrawal, France and Germany faced choice:
- Abandon project (consortium collapse)
- Continue as bilateral partnership

**Decision:** Continue, with Germany increasing share to 50%

### 5.2 Continuation Factors

**Sunk Cost Lock-In:**
- Significant investment in design work (1967-1969)
- Facility commitments in Toulouse and Hamburg
- Technical teams assembled and trained
- Supplier relationships established

**Trust Evolution:**
- UK withdrawal may have *increased* Franco-German trust
- Removed source of uncertainty
- Demonstrated mutual commitment
- Created shared narrative of resilience

**Strategic Incentives:**
- No viable independent alternatives for either country
- European integration imperative
- Long-term industrial policy alignment
- Market opportunity assessment remained positive

**Forfeiture Effects:**
- UK's wing design work continued through HS subcontract
- No asset redistribution triggered
- Minimal cascade effect due to retained industrial participation

## 6. The Return: UK Rejoins (1979)

### 6.1 Conditions for Return

**Market Validation:**
- A300B commercial success (Eastern Airlines breakthrough 1977)
- 256 orders by 1979
- A310 launch creating new opportunities

**Industrial Reorganization:**
- British Aerospace created 1977 (merger of HS, BAC, Scottish Aviation)
- Nationalization provided government control
- Consolidated UK aerospace under single entity

**Changed Strategic Assessment:**
- BAC Three-Eleven never launched
- UK aerospace clearly not competing independently
- European partnership now seen as necessity
- Airbus success demonstrated

### 6.2 Return Terms

- British Aerospace acquired 20% share
- Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus each reduced to 37.9%
- CASA retained 4.2%
- UK assumed wing production responsibility (already performing via HS)

### 6.3 Trust Implications

UK return suggests:
- Trust can be rebuilt after defection
- Success of remaining partners enables return path
- Changed domestic circumstances (nationalization) facilitated re-entry
- Partial industrial continuation (HS subcontract) maintained linkage

## 7. Model Validation Test Design

### 7.1 Initialization Parameters

Based on historical analysis, proposed initialization:

| Agent | Initial Trust | Sunk Cost Sensitivity | Domestic Veto Risk |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| UK | 0.45 | 0.3 (low — alternatives existed) | 0.5 (high — Wilson government pressure) |
| France | 0.65 | 0.7 (high — lead nation commitment) | 0.3 (moderate) |
| Germany | 0.55 | 0.6 (high — strategic imperative) | 0.25 (low) |

### 7.2 Test Protocol

1. Initialize 3-agent consortium with above parameters
2. Use ECSC-calibrated behavioral parameters **without modification**
3. Run N=1000 simulations over 12 "phases" (1967-1979, ~1 year each)
4. Compare outputs to historical pattern

### 7.3 Success Criteria

**Pattern Match (qualitative):**
- [ ] UK as primary/only defector in >50% of runs
- [ ] France-Germany continuation in >70% of post-UK-defection runs
- [ ] Eventual consortium success in >60% of runs
- [ ] Model produces "turbulent success" pattern

**Timing (if model captures temporal dynamics):**
- [ ] Defection concentrated in early phases (Phase 2-3, corresponding to 1968-1969)
- [ ] Stability increase after defection

### 7.4 Failure Modes to Watch

- Model predicts cascade failure after UK exit (historically didn't happen)
- Model predicts France or Germany as defector (historically didn't happen)
- Model predicts early project collapse (historically succeeded)
- Model produces no defections (historically UK withdrew)

## 9. Key Uncertainties for Validation

### 9.1 Trust Measurement

Historical record provides qualitative indicators but no quantified trust measures. Validation will require:
- Sensitivity analysis across plausible trust ranges
- Multiple initialization scenarios
- Comparison of output patterns rather than point estimates

### 9.2 Partial Defection

UK withdrawal was not complete — Hawker Siddeley continued as subcontractor. Model may need to account for:
- Government vs. industrial actor distinction
- Partial withdrawal mechanisms
- Maintained linkage effects on return probability

### 9.3 Return Mechanism

Current model may not have explicit return mechanism. If UK return is important for validation:
- May need to model as "new entry" rather than "return"
- Or extend model with return pathway

### 9.4 Different Sector

Aviation ≠ coal/steel. Key differences:
- Technology development timelines (longer in aviation)
- Market structure (commercial vs. industrial)
- Government role (procurement vs. regulation)
- Sunk cost character (R&D vs. infrastructure)

Validation should focus on **mechanism transferability**, not parameter identity.

## 11. Appendix: Source Excerpts

### A. UK Withdrawal Rationale (Nacelles 2022)

> "There are numerous political and economic considerations that influenced the British government's decision to distance itself from the Airbus project in 1969. Some of these considerations can be explained by the desire to prioritise the interests of British industry at a time when it, and especially the aircraft sector, found itself needing to adapt to Wilson's plans for Britain's future."

> "Britain in 1969 was still optimistic that its aircraft industry could compete against American giants, and that a partnership with European nations was not immediately necessary."

### B. Consortium Formation (Flight Global)

> "Just as Airbus Industrie was about to be created, the UK government announced on 10 April 1969 it would not be signing up — perhaps coincidentally, one day after the first UK-assembled Concorde made its maiden flight from Filton."

> "Fortunately, the UK Government's decision to withdraw as a paid-up partner in Airbus Industrie... did not discourage Hawker Siddeley (HS) from linking up with the consortium as a private venture to design and build the wings."

### C. Return Context (Wikipedia/Flight Global)

> "In January 1979 British Aerospace, which had absorbed Hawker Siddeley in 1977, acquired a 20% share of Airbus Industrie."

> "The British government withdrew support in 1969 but Hawker Siddeley was allowed to continue as supplier of the aircraft's wings due to the advanced stages of design and the reluctance of other nations to take over the wing design."
