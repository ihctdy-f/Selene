**Document Type:** Institutional Use Authorization  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** January 2026  
**Review Authority:** Director, Modeling & Simulation

---

## Purpose

This document establishes authorized and prohibited uses of the Project Selene ABM Suite v2.1 to manage institutional credibility risk and ensure appropriate application of exploratory analysis.

---

## Classification

**Analysis Type:** Exploratory Scenario Analysis  
**Accreditation Status:** Not Accredited for Decision Support  
**Validation Level:** Internal validation complete; external validation pending

---

## Authorized Uses

### Category A: Internal Analysis (Approved)

| Use Case | Authorization | Conditions |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Scenario exploration workshops | ✅ Approved | Must present as "exploratory" |
| Mechanism hypothesis generation | ✅ Approved | No predictive claims |
| Structured thinking exercises | ✅ Approved | Acknowledge limitations |
| Technical discussions with experts | ✅ Approved | Include methodology caveats |
| Internal briefings | ✅ Approved | Use appropriate framing |

### Category B: Academic/Research (Approved with Caveats)

| Use Case | Authorization | Conditions |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| Conference presentations | ✅ Approved | Present as exploratory; disclose limitations |
| Journal submission | ✅ Approved | Frame as "how-possibly" not "how-actually" |
| Collaboration with external researchers | ✅ Approved | Share conditions of use |
| Teaching/educational use | ✅ Approved | Appropriate for methodological instruction |

## Prohibited Uses

### Category X: Decision Support (Not Approved)

| Use Case | Status | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Quantitative resource allocation | ❌ Prohibited | No validated predictive accuracy |
| Budget justification | ❌ Prohibited | Precision claims not warranted |
| Go/no-go program decisions | ❌ Prohibited | Not accredited for decision support |
| Investment analysis | ❌ Prohibited | Real-world uncertainty not quantified |

### Category Y: External Communication (Not Approved)

| Use Case | Status | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Congressional testimony | ❌ Prohibited | Could misrepresent analysis maturity |
| Stakeholder briefings as "validated" | ❌ Prohibited | Validation incomplete |
| Public-facing claims about Selene viability | ❌ Prohibited | Institutional credibility risk |
| Press/media statements | ❌ Prohibited | Could be misconstrued |
| Interagency coordination (as predictive) | ❌ Prohibited | Partner expectations must be managed |

### Category Z: Derivative Products (Requires Review)

| Use Case | Status | Process |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Policy memos citing specific probabilities | 🔶 Requires approval | Submit to Program Lead |
| Integration with other models | 🔶 Requires approval | Technical review required |
| Extension to other scenarios | 🔶 Requires approval | Methodology validation needed |
| Adaptation for related programs | 🔶 Requires approval | Scope assessment required |

## Required Caveats

### Minimum Disclosure (All Uses)

Any presentation or document referencing Project Selene ABM outputs must include:

> *"These results are from exploratory scenario analysis and reflect model behavior under specified assumptions. They should not be interpreted as predictions of real-world outcomes. External validation is pending."*

### Extended Disclosure (External Audiences)

For audiences outside the immediate project team, add:

> *"The model has been calibrated to historical cases but has not undergone out-of-sample predictive testing. Confidence intervals reflect parametric uncertainty only; structural and real-world uncertainties are not quantified."*

## Citation Requirements

### Standard Citation

> Project Selene ABM Suite v2.1 (January 2026). Exploratory Scenario Analysis — Not Validated for Decision Support.

### Academic Citation

> [Authors]. (2026). *Project Selene Agent-Based Model for Consortium Cooperation Dynamics* (Version 2.1) [Exploratory Analysis]. [Institution].

## Compliance

### Responsibility

- **Users** are responsible for ensuring their use falls within authorized categories
- **Program Lead** approves Category Z (derivative) uses
- **Director, M&S** has final authority on use authorization questions

### Violations

Unauthorized use may:
- Damage institutional credibility
- Create false expectations among decision-makers
- Expose the organization to criticism if results do not materialize

Report potential misuse to Program Lead.

---

## Path to Expanded Authorization

### Requirements for Decision-Support Authorization

1. **Expert Elicitation:** Domain experts validate mechanism assumptions
2. **Out-of-Sample Test:** Predictive test against case not used for calibration
3. **Structural Uncertainty:** Multi-model ensemble analysis
4. **External Review:** Independent technical assessment
5. **Principal Scientist Sign-Off:** Formal accreditation

### Current Timeline (Estimated)

| Milestone | Target Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Expert elicitation | +60 days | Planned |
| Out-of-sample test | +90 days | Planned |
| Structural uncertainty | +180 days | Scoped |
| Decision-support authorization | TBD | Contingent |
