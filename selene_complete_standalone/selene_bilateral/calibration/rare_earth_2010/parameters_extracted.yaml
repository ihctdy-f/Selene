## 2. START PARAMETERS (September 2010)

### 2.1 State A: Japan

```yaml
state_a:
  name: "Japan"
  gdp_trillion_usd: 5.7  # World Bank 2010
  regime_type: "democracy"
  
  # Leadership
  leader: "Naoto Kan"
  leader_tenure_years: 0.25  # Took office June 2010
  approval_rating: 0.49  # Asahi Shimbun Sept 2010 (49%)
  
  # Behavioral parameters (initial estimates)
  nationalism_index: 0.55  # Elevated but constrained by pacifist norms
  escalation_threshold: 0.40  # Moderate - DPJ government cautious
  de_escalation_threshold: 0.35  # Willing to de-escalate quickly
  retaliation_propensity: 0.25  # Low - released captain under pressure
  
  # Economic
  rare_earth_dependence_on_china: 0.90  # ~90% from METI data
```

**Notes on Japan parameters:**
- Approval at 49% (Asahi Sept 2010) rose from 37% in Aug after DPJ leadership election
- Kan was politically weak (new leader, lost upper house majority in July)
- Japan released captain on Sept 24 despite domestic criticism → low retaliation propensity
- Anti-China sentiment ~85% unfavorable (Pew 2008 baseline)

### 2.2 State B: China

```yaml
state_b:
  name: "China"
  gdp_trillion_usd: 6.1  # World Bank 2010 (surpassed Japan this year)
  regime_type: "autocracy"
  
  # Leadership
  leader: "Hu Jintao"
  leader_tenure_years: 8  # In power since 2002
  approval_rating: 0.70  # Not measurable; use default
  
  # Behavioral parameters (initial estimates)
  nationalism_index: 0.70  # Elevated - anniversary of Mukden incident Sept 18
  escalation_threshold: 0.25  # Low - quick to escalate informally
  de_escalation_threshold: 0.50  # Slower to back down (face concerns)
  retaliation_propensity: 0.65  # High - multiple retaliatory measures used
  
  # Economic
  rare_earth_global_share: 0.97  # ~97% of global production
  rare_earth_export_to_japan_share: 0.33  # Japan ~1/3 of China RE exports
```

**Notes on China parameters:**
- Sept 18 = Mukden incident anniversary → nationalism spike
- China used multiple tools: RE informal embargo, cancelled bilateral meetings, moved drilling equipment to gas fields
- Anti-Japan protests on Sept 18 (controlled by government)
- Hu Jintao stable (8 years in power), but domestic pressure to be tough

### 2.3 Sector: Rare Earths

```yaml
sectors:
  rare_earths:
    # Trade flows (2010)
    a_imports_from_b_tons: 27000  # Japan imported ~27,000 tons/year from China
    a_imports_from_b_usd_billion: 0.8  # Estimated value pre-price spike
    
    # Dependency
    a_dependency_on_b: 0.90  # Japan 90% dependent on China
    b_global_production_share: 0.97  # China 97% of world production
    
    # Substitution (Japan perspective)
    a_substitution_time_months: 36  # Actual: took until ~2015 to reach 60%
    a_substitution_cost_premium: 2.0  # Alternative sources 2x more expensive
    
    # Criticality
    a_criticality_score: 0.95  # Essential for electronics, EVs, defense
    a_political_salience: 0.80  # High media coverage
    
    # Self-harm (China restricting hurts own exporters)
    b_restriction_self_harm: 0.15  # Some but limited (monopoly power)
    
    # Price data
    price_spike_factor: 10  # Prices rose ~10x (dysprosium: $91→$2377/kg)
```

### 2.4 Third Parties

```yaml
third_parties:
  usa:
    alignment_with_a: 0.6  # Pro-Japan but initially cautious
    active_at_start: false
    intervention_threshold: 0.5
    notes: "Clinton statement came later; US-Japan alliance invoked"
    
  eu:
    alignment_with_a: 0.2  # Slight Japan lean
    active_at_start: false
    intervention_threshold: 0.6
    notes: "Later joined WTO case (2012)"
    
  asean:
    alignment_with_a: 0.0  # Neutral

## 3. OBSERVED TIMELINE (Friction Estimates)

| Date | Event | Est. Friction | Source |
|------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Sept 7 | Collision incident | 0.00 | News |
| Sept 8 | Captain detained | 0.05 | News |
| Sept 13-19 | Informal RE slowdown begins | 0.30 | Reuters, industry |
| Sept 18 | Mukden anniversary protests | — | Context |
| Sept 19-23 | Customs delays expand to all Japan-bound RE | 0.50 | Trade data |
| Sept 24 | Japan releases captain | — | News |
| Sept 25-30 | Restrictions continue despite release | 0.60 | Trade data |
| Oct 1-15 | Peak restriction period | **0.75** | MOF data: 2246→1278 tons |
| Oct 16-31 | Slight easing | 0.65 | Trade data |
| Nov 2010 | Gradual normalization begins | 0.45 | Trade data |
| Dec 2010 | Continued easing | 0.30 | Trade data |
| Jan 2011 | Near-normal | 0.20 | Trade data |
| Feb 2011 | Trade normalized | 0.10 | Trade data |

**Key data point:** Japan MOF data shows imports dropped from 2,246 tons (Sept) to 1,278 tons (Oct) — a 43% decline. This maps to ~0.7-0.8 friction level.

## 8. NEXT STEPS

1. [ ] Run calibration with these parameters (500 runs)
2. [ ] Compare output distribution to targets
3. [ ] Tune: escalation_threshold, coercion_coefficient, de_escalation_threshold
4. [ ] Document final calibrated values
5. [ ] Validate on 2012 Senkaku case (out-of-sample)
