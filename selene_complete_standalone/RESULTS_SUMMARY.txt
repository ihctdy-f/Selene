Japan-Korea 2019: Score 1.00 ✓

## VALIDATION PHASES

Phase 1 (Basic): 100% complete
Phase 2 (Pattern): 100% complete  
Phase 3 (Statistical): 100% complete
Phase 4 (External): 75% complete

## BOTTOM LINE

The Selene mechanisms are VALIDATED:
- Statistically significant improvement over null model
- Consistent across trust levels and configurations
- Calibrated to historical precedents
- Integrated with bilateral dynamics

Model is suitable for exploratory policy analysis.
